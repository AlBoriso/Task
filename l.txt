From the repository, select the Clone button.

Copy the clone command (either the SSH format or the HTTPS).
If you are using the SSH protocol, ensure your public key is in Bitbucket and loaded on the local system to which you are cloning.

From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.

Paste the command you copied from Bitbucket, for example:

Clone over HTTPS

$ git clone https://username@bitbucket.org/teamsinspace/documentation-tests.git
